    "#Gene Synthesis Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input string of a DNA sequence, this function identifies annealing regions of 18-25 base pairs around the end of an interval of 30 or so base pairs. It chooses options that lack hairpins, unbalanced nucleotide content, contain at least one of each nucleotide, and have optimal GC content. Then, it synthesizes the oligonucleotides from the given strand and from its complement so that our oligos will be overlapping at the beginning and end of each one in either direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "From ChatGPT:\n",
    "The synthesis by synthons, often referred to as the Gibbard method, is a valuable approach in gene synthesis due to its ability to generate longer DNA sequences efficiently. This method involves the stepwise assembly of shorter DNA fragments called synthons, which are typically around 50 to 100 base pairs in length. [NOTE: our synthons are much longerâ€“minimum 400 bps] These synthons, each synthesized separately, contain overlapping regions that enable their assembly into larger, full-length DNA sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why synthesis by synthons is advantageous:\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Correction: Synthesis by synthons allows for the correction of errors in individual shorter fragments. If an error is detected in one of the synthons, it can be rectified by synthesizing a new correct fragment, rather than the entire sequence, thereby minimizing the impact of errors in the final assembly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity and Flexibility: The approach offers modularity, as the DNA sequence can be divided into smaller, more manageable fragments, simplifying the synthesis process. It also provides flexibility in designing and modifying specific regions or segments of the DNA sequence independently, facilitating customization of sequences for different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced Efficiency: Synthesis by assembling shorter fragments enhances the efficiency of the overall process. It is often faster and more cost-effective than synthesizing longer sequences in a single step, particularly for longer DNA constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimized Synthesis Challenges: Synthesis of longer DNA sequences as a single piece can be technically challenging and prone to errors or failures. By breaking down the sequence into smaller units (synthons), each synthesis step becomes more reliable and manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Screening and Quality Control: Assembling shorter synthons allows for better error screening and quality control at each step of synthesis. It enables the identification and rectification of errors in individual fragments before their assembly into the final full-length sequence, thereby improving the overall quality of the synthesized DNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Facilitation of Complex DNA Constructs: For the construction of complex DNA sequences, such as genes with repeated motifs or intricate structures, synthesis by synthons provides a systematic and controlled approach to build and validate each part separately before assembly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the synthesis by synthons or the Gibbard method offers a practical and effective strategy for synthesizing longer DNA sequences, enabling error correction, modularity, efficiency, and enhanced quality control throughout the process. These advantages make it a valuable method in gene synthesis and synthetic biology research."
